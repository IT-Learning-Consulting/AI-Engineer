32nd Sigmarz eit, 2511 I C

My Lord Konrad von Siert, Baron of Siert and Castellan of Ostergrootsch, Greetings and salutations, ~ ~

Herein find a summons and general information concerning the Empire, your homeland.

I am instructed to inform you that your lord and father, Duke Ottokar von Siert, officially recognises your claim to inherit his land and titles within the Reikland, and orders you to his side. Your exile in the Border Princes is at an end, and you must make immediate preparations for departure. ~ ~

In his wisdom, your father has employed an armed escort to assist. I am in command, and, Sigmar willing, will arrive sometime near Sonnestill.

I shall also take your education in hand.

It was decided by your father's advisors that a true devotee of Sigmar - the Empire's patron deity - should promptly take charge of your education. Your father, of course, agreed, for the Cult of Sigmar should always be heeded.

#### Forget What You Know

There are several matters I would have you consider before I arrive in Khypris. You likely think life in the Empire will be much the same as the sunny lifestyle you currently enjoy in the Border Princes - after all, there are the same eight days in the week, the same sun and moons, and the same gods.
{'filename': 'the_empire.md', 'extension': '.md'}
(INDEX: 6)
LENGTH: 433

--------------------------------------------------

Node 7:
I regret to inform you such presumptions are incorrect: the Empire is not like the Border Princes, and you are ill-prepared for the threats it hides. Put plainly: you are not safe, and most of what you think you know will lead you to danger. ~ ~

#### The Gods

As you know, throughout the Old World folk freely worship many different gods, most commonly those directly impacting their daily lives.
{'filename': 'the_empire.md', 'extension': '.md'}
(INDEX: 7)
LENGTH: 398

--------------------------------------------------

Node 8:
So, if someone is hurt, one prays to Shallya, Goddess of Healing and Mercy; when a hunt fails, one prays to Taal, God of Animals and Wild Places; and if crops should wither, one turns to Rhya, Goddess of Life and Fertility.

But in your homeland, one god rises head and shoulders above the others: Sigmar, who founded the Empire when mortal, and now stands as its patron deity.
{'filename': 'the_empire.md', 'extension': '.md'}
(INDEX: 8)
LENGTH: 377

--------------------------------------------------

Node 9:
In the grand province where your lands lie, the Reikland, the Cult of Sigmar dominates: every village has a temple, every town has several, and the capital, Altdorf, has more holy sites dedicated to Sigmar than any bother to count. Each Festag (what the locals call the last day of the week - the one you call 'Holiday'), all are expected to attend 'throng' at a local temple, where Sigmar's priests preach lessons concerning the founder of the Empire, he who wielded the Warhammer.
{'filename': 'the_empire.md', 'extension': '.md'}
(INDEX: 9)
LENGTH: 482

--------------------------------------------------

Node 10:
Further, many temples require all able-bodied folk to train at arms weekly with the local priests or their representatives, forming the core of local militias to support the State Armies. In larger towns and cities, it is only the faithful and the lost that attend these weekly duties, but in rural areas, any not attending are viewed with deep suspicion. Trust me, my lord, this is a cult you will need to understand, for most folk of the Reikland are ingrained with its customs, and you must appear to be, also.

(INDEX: 10)
LENGTH: 513

--------------------------------------------------

Node 11:
You may think you understand Sigmar because there is a shrine in Khypris. You do not. ~ ~ ~ ~

#### Witches

One cannot talk of Sigmar without also discussing witches - those able to use magic. Obviously, it's a subject close to my heart, although I prefer to be called a Magister, as I am trained by the Colleges of Magic. The folk of the Empire, like all peoples of the Old World, are solid and practical, and quick to remove dangerous elements from their communities.
{'filename': 'the_empire.md', 'extension': '.md'}
(INDEX: 11)
LENGTH: 470

--------------------------------------------------

Node 12:
Given the Cult of Sigmar preaches that Sigmar was tempted and betrayed by evil witches, it will come as no surprise that in areas of strong Sigmar worship, witches are not just viewed with suspicion, they are vilified. Fortunately, the talent for witchery is very rare, but for those born with it any unexpected manifestation of their arcane powers may see them burned at the stake, even if Imperial Law states they should be taken to the Colleges of Magic.
{'filename': 'the_empire.md', 'extension': '.md'}
(INDEX: 12)
LENGTH: 457

--------------------------------------------------

Node 13:
~ ~ ~

#### The Colleges of Magic

There is no formal centre of magical learning in the Border Princes. Those able to do magic either work it out independently, accidentally kill themselves, are hunted down, or find a master to teach them. Most such masters practice ancient forms of magic that are certainly dangerous, ranging from supposedly benign hedge witches and seers to those who risk their very souls, including power-blinded fools like necromancers and daemonologists. In the Empire, it's very different.
{'filename': 'the_empire.md', 'extension': '.md'}
(INDEX: 13)
LENGTH: 514

--------------------------------------------------

Node 14:
To practice any magic you must have a licence, and the only way to secure one is to be a graduated Wizard of the Colleges of Magic in Altdorf, or be an Elf -they receive special dispensation for their part in founding the Colleges - assuming they register with the Colleges, of course. If you have no licence and cast magic, you are breaking the law and should be either taken to the Colleges for proper training or tried as a criminal. Most commonly, illegal witches are tried by mob and lynched.
{'filename': 'the_empire.md', 'extension': '.md'}
(INDEX: 14)
LENGTH: 497

--------------------------------------------------

Node 15:
Which, to be clear, is also illegal, although few are punished for this crime as most would prefer to see a witch dead, regardless of the legality. While murdering suspected witches may sound extreme to your ears, there are good reasons for caution: all witches channel the Winds of Magic, invisible flows of power that course across the world, and many claim these Winds originate from the Ruinous Powers. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

#### The Ruinous Powers

The less I speak of this the better, and might I suggest you never speak of it.
{'filename': 'the_empire.md', 'extension': '.md'}
(INDEX: 15)
LENGTH: 522

--------------------------------------------------

Node 16:
There is always something listening. At its simplest, whatever your current tutors pretend, the dark gods do exist. They whisper of the ruination of all things, and too many fools listen. But do the Winds of Magic blow from the Ruinous Powers, turning good folk into witches, and twisting minds and flesh in their wake ? That's not a question I think I can answer. What I can say is that the dark gods' influence is felt at all levels of society, and those drawing too close are always changed by what they encounter.
{'filename': 'the_empire.md', 'extension': '.md'}
(INDEX: 16)
LENGTH: 517

--------------------------------------------------

Node 17:
This is why folk are terrified of mutation: they believe it is a mark of damnation, a sign the dark gods now hold your soul. Even talking in the most general terms about such subjects may well bring you to the attention of the witch hunters, so remain wary for signs of this dark corruption but do not betray that you are even aware of its existence. ~ ~ ~

#### The Powers That Be

'In the Borderlands, all may come to power, and all may come to rule! In the Empire, we willingly wrap ourselves in chains!'
{'filename': 'the_empire.md', 'extension': '.md'}
(INDEX: 17)
LENGTH: 507

--------------------------------------------------

Node 18:
~

Those were the ardent words of a young, idealistic agitator I met in Wissenburg. Consider what she says, for you will soon encounter those who believe it true. In the Empire, you are born to a station, and no amount of cleverness or capability will change what the gods plan, or so those in power repeatedly claim. If you are born noble, you are forever noble; born farming, forever farming. And so it remains.

(INDEX: 18)
LENGTH: 413

--------------------------------------------------

Node 19:
But as you personally know, my lord, the chance offerings of birth can be changed and manipulated by forces far from divine. And even in the Empire, new freedoms are being bought every day. ~

#### The Cities and Towns

For all the stratified layers of society are supposedly immutable, the flourishing towns and cities of the Empire, safely wrapped with high walls of stone and patrolled by liveried State Soldiers, have allowed a new class of rich merchants and burghers to rise.
{'filename': 'the_empire.md', 'extension': '.md'}
(INDEX: 19)
LENGTH: 481

--------------------------------------------------

Node 20:
The Reikland, as the richest of all the Empire's grand provinces, has a growing 'middle' class of such enormity it frequently rises to prominence, with rich individuals buying their way to freedom and power. An example of this are towns called 'Freiburgs' or 'free towns', meaning they selfgovern without significant interference from the nobility in return for services, military support, or, most commonly, large quantities of coin.
{'filename': 'the_empire.md', 'extension': '.md'}
(INDEX: 20)
LENGTH: 434

--------------------------------------------------

Node 21:
Although the concept of a Freiburg is old, never have so many been seen in such a small area as increasingly more towns are buying their freedom; although all this seemingly changes nothing for those toiling in the fields. ~ ~ ~

#### Rural Life ~

Where the towns and cities are becoming freer, it could be argued the opposite is the case for many rural communities.
{'filename': 'the_empire.md', 'extension': '.md'}
(INDEX: 21)
LENGTH: 367

--------------------------------------------------

Node 22:
Over two hundred years ago, Emperor Magnus the Pious famously enshrined the rights of all to be paid for their labour, but many noble houses did not agree with this attack on their rights and continue to resist to this day. ~

Enlightened provinces such as the lands ruled by your father, where farmers work land they lease, selling any produce they harvest at local markets for personal profit, paying taxes as determined by the local authorities, are widespread.
{'filename': 'the_empire.md', 'extension': '.md'}
(INDEX: 22)
LENGTH: 464

--------------------------------------------------

Node 23:
But in some isolated regions the peasantry are forced to slave on farms they do not own, turning over almost all produce to their lieges, living in total ignorance of the freedoms the Imperial Law grants them. Many folk will put up with a lot so long as horns echo across the land each campaign season as noble lords send the State Army to rid the encroaching forest of whatever foulness has gathered.

Node 24:
~ ~ ~ ~

And it is there one of the greatest differences between your current home in Khypris and Sigmar's Holy Empire lies: the endless forests. The Empire is blanketed in dense woodlands, and few dare venture into their depths, for their twisted branches hide far worse than simple bandits, beastmen, and forest goblins. ~

#### Travel

Bisecting the Border Princes, the Khyprian Road is famous for its relative safety.
{'filename': 'the_empire.md', 'extension': '.md'}
(INDEX: 24)
LENGTH: 421

--------------------------------------------------

Node 25:
Its entire six-hundred mile length is cleared on both sides for many miles, ensuring would-be bandits have few places to hide. The opposite circumstances apply in the Empire. Almost all the major roads cut through thick forests with uncounted ambush points, leaving travel by foot extraordinarily dangerous.
{'filename': 'the_empire.md', 'extension': '.md'}
(INDEX: 25)
LENGTH: 307

--------------------------------------------------

Node 26:
Thus, wealthy folk travel by river as most major towns are connected by river or canal, and the major waterways of the Empire are often so wide you can barely see the opposite banks - let alone any potential wreckers hiding in the rushes - making them significantly safer than tree-lined highways where bandits lurk around every corner. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Of course, sometimes a road journey is the only option, especially when one is travelling to one of the many highland fortifications or mining towns. In such circumstances, I recommend you travel by coach.
{'filename': 'the_empire.md', 'extension': '.md'}
(INDEX: 26)
LENGTH: 553

--------------------------------------------------

Node 27:
These not only provide comfortable travelling conditions between all major destinations, but their routes are patrolled by road wardens, making them relatively safe. The Empire is also significantly more civilised than the Border Princes, so boasts many reliable coaching houses. ~ ~ ~

#### Patrols

Recognising the threat posed by highway pillagers, all the major roads of the Reikland are patrolled by mounted squads of road wardens.
{'filename': 'the_empire.md', 'extension': '.md'}
(INDEX: 27)
LENGTH: 436

--------------------------------------------------

Node 28:
Most are peacetime State Army cavalrymen put to use by local nobles, but some are privately hired, often by merchant or coaching houses, to better maintain the peace and protect expensive assets. When travelling away from the primary trade routes, the roads are not so well maintained, and some are lucky to ever see a road warden, so I suggest avoiding these dark corners of the Empire, for the local folk are often all-too-quick to take offense, all your trappings, and perhaps even your life.

LENGTH: 495

--------------------------------------------------

Node 29:
~ ~ ~

The rivers are similarly patrolled, but by strong-backed riverwardens in a variety of different vessels ranging from small patrol boats to small warships called Shipswords. These wardens are supported by the Imperial Navy, which is, against all the expectations of outsiders, based in the Reiksport at Altdorf, hundreds of miles upriver from the sea. The navy's large warships patrol the waters to Marienburg, where the river Reik is often many miles wide, and very deep.

--------------------------------------------------

Node 30:
~

#### The Law

The powers granted to wardens patrolling the rivers and roads, and to the watch patrolling the streets of the Empire's towns and cities, vary significantly from province to province. Small infractions of the law normally result in stern words and spot fines, most of which never leave the pocket of the lawman concerned.
{'filename': 'the_empire.md', 'extension': '.md'}
(INDEX: 30)
LENGTH: 337

--------------------------------------------------

Node 31:
In larger towns and cities, it is also common to find petty courts run by watch captains who judge cases brought before them, handing out fines of a shilling or two for most misdeeds, with serious crimes referred to a higher authority. For such crimes, the accused is taken before a local court, most commonly officiated by a judge, noble, magistrate, or a cleric of the Goddess of Justice, Verena. These trials are rarely fair, so it is wise to never let matters proceed so far.

Node 32:
~

As a lord of the Reikland, you cannot be tried by a normal court, so should you ever find yourself accused, do not be afraid to make your birthright known. Should I not be with you, send word to the Grey College and ask for me by name. I will come. To be sure you understand, only your father, as your lord, has the right to judge you.

Node 33:
However, another noble may appeal against your father's judgement; should this occur, only the High Lord Steward of the Reikland has the right to overrule your father in matters of criminal law. ~

But such almost never happens. The High Lord Steward has not held court for over fifty years, for most nobles are too powerful to bring to task. Instead, deals are made, charges are dropped, and the problems disappear.

Node 34:
#### Be Careful

So, given the many risks, I hope you can understand why your father sends an escort to ensure your safety. Your inexperience with the folk of the Empire could easily lead to disaster. For all you may think a local watchman is there to help you, or a riverwarden seems a helpful fellow, they may be as corrupt as the folk they are tasked to detain. This is why I come. Let my experience be your teacher, so you need not learn from your own errors, which could prove fatal.
