# TRAPS

Many of the places where your adventurers will go may be laced with traps to deter (or kill) would-be thieves, spies, and assassins. Traps may be triggered in a number of ways, and will have different effects. Examples are provided here, but GMs may prefer to invent their own death-dealing devices. Inventing traps is part of the fun of being a GM. Use traps with care, thoughâ€”the fun can go out of the game quickly if the adventurers are constantly being wiped out by a succession of fendish traps.

# SETTING A TRAP

As described in **WFRP4** (p130), given enough time, anyone with the *Set Trap* Skill is automatically assumed to be able to set and disarm traps of all varieties, from mundane animal traps to devious dungeon devices. A Test is normally only required if attempting to use the Skill swiftly or under pressure, or if the trap is especially complex. Setting or disarming most traps requires an **Average (+20) Set Trap** Test, but more complex devices will need an Extended Test with a target SL over several rounds to set (or disarm).

A character lacking the *Set Trap* Skill is unable to fgure out how to set or disarm complex mechanisms; however, they may attempt to set/ disarm a *Simple* trap such as an animal trap by passing a **Hard (-20) Dexterity** Test (only one test allowed per type of trap).

# ACTIVATING A TRAP

Traps can be activated in several ways. Characters treading on a pressure plate, tripping a thin wire, pulling a disguised lever, etc, may activate the trap.

It should be assumed that characters are being reasonably careful. Depending on how alert the PCs are, the GM may allow a pre-emptive **Challenging (+0) Perception** Test to spot the trap before it is triggered. Te length of time required to fnd a trap is ultimately up to the GM, but as a rule of thumb, it will take about 1d10 minutes to complete a search (during which time there may be random creature encounters). Tere is, however, no reason that all traps need to be equally discoverable or disarmable, if the GM wishes to adjust any trap modifers.

Otherwise, so long as they are Walking, a character can avoid the effects of a trap by passing a **Challenging (+0) Dodge** Test. Te Difficulty increases to **Hard (-20)** if the character is Running, or **Very Hard (-30)** if the character is Sprinting.

A character with the *Set Trap* Skill may modify their **Perception** and **Dodge** Tests by +20 each.

# BOOBY-TRAPS

Booby-traps are small-scale traps, usually connected to chest lids, locks, clasps, handles, etc. Common devices include poisoned spikes or darts, contact poisons applied to handles, or poisonous gases made to billow forth once a lid is opened.

If the character is being reasonably careful, booby-traps can be avoided by a successful **Challenging (+0) Dodge** Test. Otherwise, the GM may impose a Difficulty of **Difficult (-10)** or **Hard (-20)**. Characters with the *Set Trap* Skill gain a bonus of +20.

Characters with the *Set Trap* Skill can also spot a booby-trap before triggering it with a successful **Average (+20) Perception** Test. Unlike larger traps, booby-traps can be disarmed by any character who makes a successful **Hard (-20) Dexterity** Test.

# TYPICAL TRIGGERS

Here are a few examples of ways in which traps can be activated. Each example is followed by the corresponding Test Difficulty to disarm a standard version of this trigger.

#### **Door**

A simple catch or switch activates the trap as the door, hatch, etc, is opened.

*Simple: Average (+20) Set Trap Test* 

#### **Procedures**

A set of procedures must be performed in order to avoid setting off the trap. **Example:** 1, pull the lever on the left; 2, pull the lever on the right. Pulling them in the correct order opens the door (or whatever); while doing so incorrectly activates the trap.

*Complex: Extended Challenging (+0) Set Trap Test for 4 SL* 

#### **Sound**

Any average or loud noise within a few yards will operate the trap (a sort of avalanche effect). *Complex: Extended Challenging (+0) Set Trap Test for 8 SL* 

### **Stone Slab**

A simple pressure-plate or a moving stone slab cleverly balanced to act as a trigger.

*Complex: Extended Challenging (+0) Set Trap Test for 6 SL* 

#### **Trip-wire**

A simple wire strung across a corridor. *Simple: Challenging (+0) Set Trap Test* 

#### **Weight**

In effect a whole room or corridor which acts like a stone slab. Te combined weight of two, three, or more creatures sets off the trap. *Complex: Extended Challenging (+0) Set Trap Test for 10 SL* 

# TYPICAL TRAP EFFECTS

Wounds caused by traps will vary depending on the mechanism. Te basic procedure is as follows: Roll **1d100** to determine the Hit Location and take the Units Die as the SL for Damage, then add the specifc modifer in the trap description. If the Units Die is '**0**', the target suffers a Critical Hit to the same Location. Unless otherwise specifed, Damage is reduced by the victim's Toughness Bonus and Armour Points as normal. As with all damage, the victim of a trap suffers at least 1 Wound.

## **Animal Trap**

Similar to a mantrap, but smaller and lighter, intended for hunting and trapping. (When used to gather food, a successful **Outdoor Survival** Test feeds two people, and an extra two people per SL.) If a character or creature is trapped, the jaws target the victim's legs only. *Damage = SL + 5* 

#### **Bomb**

A mechanism fings a bomb at the unfortunate victim. Te bomb has the *Blast 5* and *Impact* Qualities. *Damage = SL + 12* 

#### **Blocks**

Passageways or doors are suddenly blocked by falling stone slabs, iron bars, sliding walls, etc.

### **Ceiling Lowers**

Whole or part of the ceiling lowers and will crush anyone underneath within 1d10 rounds. *Damage = Death* 

### **Chute**

A chute opens underfoot like a pit, and leads to new parts of an underground complex. Anyone falling down a chute may lose some or all of their equipment at the same time. In addition, depending on the slope of the chute, they may take Falling Damage.

## **Deadfall**

A block falls from the ceiling: Unless it is avoided, the block causes a Critical Hit and Falling Damage to the nearest location (usually the Head).

*Damage = Critical Hit + Falling Damage* 

#### **Gas**

Dangerous gas billows out, fooding a 2x2-yard Area of Effect from the trap and spreading at the rate of 1 yard per round for 1d5 Rounds. Te effect depends on the gas deployed for the trap. Te GM should feel free to adjust any of the following results as needed. Roll 1d10:

- **1d10** *Gas Type Effects* **1** *Blinding* Te trap sets off a gas that gets into the eyes of all within the area, causing you to suffer 1d10 minus **TB** *Blinded* conditions (minimum of 1).
	- **2** *Explosive* You suffer 1d10 Damage modifed by Toughness Bonus only, and you gain +1 *Ablaze* condition.
- **3-4** *Neurological* You must pass a **Challenging (+0) Cool** Test or suffer the mind-bending effect of the gas for 1d10 Rounds. If the effect requires a Target, this will be the frst person or species that you see while suffering the effect. If the **Cool Test** results in a *Critical Fumble*, you suffer the psychological effect forever (until treated, if GM allows). Any creature who is immune to psychology remains unaffected. Te GM may choose an effect or roll 1d10:

 1) *Afraid*, 2) *Animosity*, 3) *Belligerent*, 4) *Bestial*, 5) *Frenzy*, 6) *Hatred*, 7) *Hungry*, 8) *Phobia*, 9) *Stupid*, 10) *Trauma*.

- **5-6** *Poison* Each Round you stay in the gas, you suffer an attack with the *Venom (Difficult)* Trait.
- **7** *Smoke* Te area flls with smoke, blocking line of sight, for 1d10 Rounds. Also, each turn you gain +1 *Stunned* condition from the violent coughing until you are free of the smoke.
- **8-9** *Unconscious* Te area flls with an invisible gas which instantly knocks out any victim who fails a **Difficult (-10) Endurance** Test; you take an *Unconscious* Condition.

**10** *Warpstone* Te area flls with a greenish-purple gas that oozes corruption, shredding the souls of anyone in its area of effect. You take the *Prone* Condition until you exit the gas. While *Prone*, on your turn you must pass a **Challenging (+0) Endurance** Test or gain 1 Corruption point, as per the *Corruption (Minor)* Trait.

### **Mantrap**

Te jaws of a mantrap close on the victim's leg; the creature gains +1 *Entangled* Condition with **S** 60.

*Damage = SL + 6* 

#### **Missile**

A bolt, spear, or dart is poised to fre as soon as the trap is activated. Unless dodged, the missile causes damage as per the specifc weapon, including the Weapon Qualities and Flaws. Additionally, there is a 30% chance (or per GM's decision) that the missile contains poison and the target takes a *Poisoned* Condition. Roll for the Location.

*Bolt Damage = SL + 9 + Impale Quality Dart Damage = SL + 4 + Impale Quality Spear Damage = SL + 6 + Impale Quality* 

### **Pendulum**

A swinging axe or blade strikes a random Location; if the Character dodged, the pendulum continues to swing every Round until it strikes. *Damage = SL + 8* 

#### **Pit**

Te foor opens up to reveal a pit several yards deep (roll 1d10 if needed). Such pits can have spikes, in which case the victim must make a **Challenging (+0) Dodge** Test to avoid the spikes; if you fail, reverse the roll to determine Hit Location.

*Pit Damage = Falling Damage Spike Damage = SL + 7 + Impale Quality*
